      A new field, 
      <br>
      unfamiliar faces as far as I can see,  
    <br>
      All they can see are the differences. 
    <br>
      Un matching wool, a foreign name,  
    <br>
      a accent that echoes somewhere else. 
    <br>
      Yet expecting me to fall into line, 
    <br>
      to be herded quietly into the flock. </div>
  </body>

  <div id="poem-2">
      Ive only heard stories of joy, 
    <br>
     stitched between each blade of green, 
    <br>
     the roots that he established, 
    <br>
     that feel so foreign to me. </div>


  <div id="poem-3">
      But in this field, as strange as it is,
    <br>
      It is some forgotten part of me,
    <br>
     My father grew in this soil, 
    <br>
     ran through this grass, 
    <br> 
    his laughter sewn into its roots,
    <br>
    He belonged here. </div>
